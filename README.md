# freeChipotle
"Chipotle will be giving out up to one million dollar's worth of free burritos during this year's (2019) NBA Finals by tweeting a unique code every time one of the televised announcers say "free" during this year's men's professional basketball finals." The first x users to text the code to Chipotle get a free burrito. 

## Purpose
Launch this app to poll Chipotle's twitter feed during the finals for the free burrito coupon code, copy the code to the system's clipboard, so it can be quickly "texted" from the computer by the user monitoring the app.

For maximum effectiveness, watch the finals and launch this app immediately after hearing the keyword to save API calls. 

## Other
Should use webhooks in the future instead of polling... I was too hungry to learn about it
Had integrated with Twilio's API to automatically send  but chipotle blocked virtual numbers. 
Side note: this did get me a free burrito.
